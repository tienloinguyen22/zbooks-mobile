## Why React Native Starter Kit?

As I have worked on many React native projects for my company, I have struggles doing repetitive tasks for setting up the projects, integrating 3rd-party libraries (very time-consuming and sometimes very painful :( ) and deployment. So I made this starter kit to help myself, my teammates and you guys save our precious time to focus on the business and make best apps.

What this starter kit provides:

- **Authentication** (using Firebase) with Facebook, Google, email and phone no.
- **[CodePush](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push)** integration for OTA update (production lifesaver).
- **[Rematch](https://github.com/thinhtran3588/react-native-starter-kit/wiki)** as the state manager - Redux best practices without the boilerplate
- **Well-defined structure** for aim-to-scale apps
- **Automation scripts** of building Android/iOS apps & deploying to Playstore Alpha channel and Appstore Testflight using **[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/)**
- And **more**
